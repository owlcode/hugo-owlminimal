## Hugo Theme - OWL Minimal

![Build](https://github.com/owlcode/hugo-owlminimal/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Simple and minimal Black & White theme built for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ðŸ’ª 
Based on HTML divs and jQuery is a great starting point for bigger integration ðŸ‘€

## Instalation
I hope by now you have node, hugo, git available in your $PATH. Let's then move to

```
$ git clone git@github.com:owlcode/hugo-owlminimal.git
$ hugo server --source hugo-owlminimal/exampleSite --themesDir ../..
```
